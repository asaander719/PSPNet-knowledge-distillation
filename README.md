# PSPNet-knowledge-distillation
This repository uses a knowledge distillation method to teach the PSPNet model of ResNet18 backbone with the PSPNet model of ResNet50 backbone. All the models are trained and tested on the PASCAL-VOC2012 dataset.
Please note that you should train a teacher model( PSPNet model of ResNet50 backbone) at first, and you can refer to the oringinal public code https://github.com/hszhao/semseg
